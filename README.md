# SaferHoods - Real-time Emergency Response System

![Project Logo Placeholder](client/public/logo.png)

## üöÄ Overview

SaferHoods is an innovative emergency response system prototype, developed during a hackathon, designed to bridge the gap between citizens and emergency services. It leverages real-time communication and location-based services to enable instant reporting, live tracking, and seamless interaction between reporters and authorities. This repository showcases the core functionalities and architecture of the system.

## ‚ú® Key Features Implemented

- **Real-time Incident Reporting**: Users can report emergencies via the web app, including realtime location data.
- **Live Location Tracking**: Authorities can view reported incidents and reporter locations on a map in real-time.
- **Two-way Communication (Web App)**: Reporters can Report any Incident / communicate with authorities anonymously via:
    - **Text Chat**: Real-time messaging within an active incident session using Socket.IO.
    - **Voice Call**: Direct WebRTC-based voice calls between reporter and authority.
- **Offline Voice Reporting Hotline**:
    - Users can call a designated hotline number to report emergencies in offline mode.
    - Calls are recorded by Twilio.
    - Recordings are automatically sent to an external transcription service.
    - The system processes the transcription to attempt automatic incident Report creation.
- **Interactive Map Interface**:
    - Utilizes Leaflet for displaying incident locations.
    - Implements marker clustering to handle numerous incidents efficiently.
- **Real-time Notifications**:
    - In-app notifications via Socket.IO for events like incoming calls, messages, and status changes.
    - Email notifications sent to relevant parties (e.g., assigned teams, reporters) during the incident processing workflow.
- **Incident Management**: Basic system for tracking incident status, severity, and assigned teams.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Frontend (Client)
- React.js (with Vite)
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Leaflet & React-Leaflet for interactive maps
- Socket.IO Client for real-time web communication
- WebRTC for peer-to-peer voice calls
- React Router for navigation

### Backend (Server)
- Node.js with Express.js
- Socket.IO for real-time web communication & signaling
- Supabase for database persistence
- Twilio for Voice API (handling incoming calls, recording)
- Nodemailer for sending email notifications
- external transcription service (whisper model)
- Turf.js for geospatial calculations (e.g., distance)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

- **Client-Server Model**: Separate React frontend and Node.js backend.
- **Real-time Layer**: Socket.IO manages WebSocket connections for chat, call signaling, and status updates.
- **WebRTC Integration**: Peer-to-peer voice communication established via WebRTC, signaled through the Socket.IO server.
- **Database**: Supabase stores user, incident, team, and other application data.
- **External Service Integrations**:
    - **Twilio**: Handles the voice call reporting channel.
    - **Transcription Service**: Processes voice recordings from Twilio calls.
    - **Email Service**: Nodemailer configured to send transactional emails.
- **Incident Processing Logic**: Server-side services handle incident validation, severity calculation, team matching, and notification triggering.

## üì± Features in Detail

### Emergency Reporting (Web & Phone)
- **Web App**: Registered users report incidents with type, severity, description, and automatic location capture.
- **Phone Hotline**: Anonymous reporting via a Twilio number, triggering recording and automated transcription/processing.
- Status tracking (e.g., pending, active, resolved).

### Real-time Communication
- **Web Chat**: Socket.IO powers instant text messaging between connected parties in an incident.
- **Web Voice Call**: WebRTC enables direct voice calls within the app interface, with mute functionality.

### Location Services & Mapping
- Interactive Leaflet map displaying incident locations.
- Marker clustering prevents map clutter with large numbers of incidents.
- Real-time location updates visible on the map.

### Automated Phone Reporting Workflow
1. Call received by Twilio.
2. Call recorded.
3. Recording sent to a configured external transcription API.
4. Transcription received and parsed.
5. Incident automatically created in Supabase based on transcribed information.
6. Incident processed for team assignment and notifications.

### Security Features
- JWT ensures secure API access for logged-in web users.
- Basic role distinction (Reporter, Authority).
